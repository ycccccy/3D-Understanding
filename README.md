| **S²-MLLM (2025-12)** | [S²-MLLM: Boosting Spatial Reasoning Capability of MLLMs for 3D Visual Grounding with Structural Guidance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01223) | Multi-view RGB / Text | 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes from natural language. MLLMs excel at 2D inputs but struggle with 3D spatial structure. S²-MLLM introduces implicit spatial reasoning: it acquires 3D structural understanding during training via a structure-enhanced module with intra-/inter-view attention and multi-level position encoding, eliminating inefficient point-cloud rendering. Experiments on ScanRefer, Nr3D, Sr3D show superior performance, generalization and efficiency. | — | ScanRefer / Nr3D / Sr3D | — |
| **SpaceDrive (2025-12)** | [SpaceDrive: Infusing Spatial Awareness into VLM-based Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10719v1) | Multi-view RGB / Depth / Ego-state / Text | End-to-end autonomous driving methods built on vision language models (VLMs) have undergone rapid development driven by their universal visual understanding and strong reasoning capabilities obtained from the large-scale pretraining. However, we find that current VLMs struggle to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships which is a fundamental requirement for systems interacting with the physical world. To address this issue, we propose SpaceDrive, a spatial-aware VLM-based driving framework that treats spatial information as explicit positional encodings (PEs) instead of textual digit tokens, enabling joint reasoning over semantic and spatial representations. SpaceDrive employs a universal positional encoder to all 3D coordinates derived from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. These 3D PEs are first superimposed to augment the corresponding 2D visual tokens. Meanwhile, they serve as a task-agnostic coordinate representation, replacing the digit-wise numerical tokens as both inputs and outputs for the VLM. This mechanism enables the model to better index specific visual semantics in spatial reasoning and directly regress trajectory coordinates rather than generating digit-by-digit, thereby enhancing planning accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that SpaceDrive achieves state-of-the-art open-loop performance on the nuScenes dataset and the second-best Driving Score of 78.02 on the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark over existing VLM-based methods. | — | nuScenes / Bench2Drive | https://zhenghao2519.github.io/SpaceDrive_Page/ |
| **DSR (2025-12)** | [Learning to Reason in 4D: Dynamic Spatial Reasoning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20557) | RGB video / Text | VLMs excel at static scenes but struggle with dynamic spatial reasoning (DSR) about evolving 3D geometry over time due to scarce 4D-aware data. DSR Suite is proposed: an automated pipeline generates million-scale multiple-choice QA pairs from in-the-wild videos with geometric cues (camera pose, point clouds, trajectories, etc.). A lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) injects question-relevant 4D priors into VLM. Qwen2.5-VL-7B + DSR significantly boosts dynamic spatial reasoning while maintaining general video understanding. | — | DSR-Train / DSR-Bench / Kubric-4D / Something-Something V2 | — |
| **VLM² (2025-11)** | [Vision-Language Model with Memory for Spatial Reasoning in 3D Found](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20644) | RGB video / Text | Current VLMs fall short in long-horizon video spatial reasoning due to semantic-geometric misalignment and lack of persistent 3D memory. VLM² introduces a dual-memory module: working memory (sliding window) and episodic memory (long-term consolidation) to maintain a view-consistent 3D-aware representation purely from 2D video. It sets state-of-the-art among video-only models on multiple benchmarks. | — | VSI-Bench / SQA3D / SPBench | — |

SpaceMind adopts a dual-encoder architecture (InternViT + VGGT) and a lightweight Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module that treats camera representation as an active guiding modality rather than passive metadata. The module applies camera-conditioned biasing and query-independent weighting. SpaceMind sets new SOTA on VSI-Bench, SQA3D and SPBench, demonstrating effective spatially grounded intelligence. | — | VSI-Bench / SQA3D / SPBench | — |
| **3DThinker (2025-10)** | [Think with 3D: Geometric Imagination Grounded Spatial Reasoning from Limited Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18632) | RGB (single or few views) / Text | Though recent advances in vision–language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge. Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on explicitly labeled 3D data for training Specifically, our training consists of two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g., VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D representations into multimodal reasoning. | — | MindCube-Tiny / Ego3D-Bench / VSI-Bench /  SPBench/CV-Bench/SPAR-Bench/ViewSpatialBench

| **3DRS (2025-06)** | [MLLMs Need 3D-Aware Representation Supervision for Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01946) | Images / Text / 3D Features | Recent advances in scene understanding have leveraged multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for 3D reasoning by capitalizing on their strong 2D pretraining. However, the lack of explicit 3D data during MLLM pretraining limits 3D representation capability. In this paper, we investigate the 3D-awareness of MLLMs by evaluating multi-view correspondence and reveal a strong positive correlation between the quality of 3D-aware representation and downstream task performance. Motivated by this, we propose 3DRS, a framework that enhances MLLM 3D Representation learning through Supervision from pretrained 3D foundation models. Our approach aligns MLLM visual features with rich 3D knowledge distilled from 3D models, effectively improving scene understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and MLLMs—including visual grounding, captioning, and question answering—demonstrate consistent performance gains. | — | Multi3DRef / ScanRefer3D / Scan2Cap / ScanQA / SQA3D | https://visual-ai.github.io/3drs |
